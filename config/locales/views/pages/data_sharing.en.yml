      title: Data sharing
      public_repo_text: here
      subtext1_html: You can find data to our projects below. The data we are sharing contain tweet IDs. From the IDs the full tweets can be obtained using a script and explanations provided %{public_repo}.
      subtext2_html: "The data has been collected through the Twitter filter stream API using a list of keywords and languages (provided below).  Note that in some cases the keywords/languages had to be updated after a while (e.g. as new terms emerged).  Should you have requests for only a subset of the data (or any kind of aggregate data), please get in touch through %{mail}. IMPORTANT: Due to the unforeseen high volume from the COVID-19 stream and restrictions imposed by Twitter, the data collected after February 25 will likely be incomplete and the absolute counts will be in reality much higher. Despite this caveat we decided to share the subsample of data we are collecting."
      subtext3_html: Thank you for giving attribution if you end up using the data.
