      about_crowdbreaks_html: Crowdbreaks is a health trend tracking system, currently developed by the %{href_group} at %{href_EPFL} in Switzerland. The system is designed to track trends about health and disease-related issues in real-time across different countries. By obtaining feedback from users the system will eventually improve and be able to draw more accurate conclusions about these issues.

      how_does_it_work: Crowdbreaks collects tweets with keywords that might be related to specific health topics. By using natural language processing and machine learning techniques the system tries to filter relevant from non-relevant content. By providing more meta information (labelling) of the tweets, these algorithms will continuously improve to detect tweets which are truly relevant for the issue at hand.

      why_crowdsourcing_html: Millions of people use social media every day to share how they feel, both good and bad. This is, in a sense, like having millions of sensors which can help us understand the health situation in real-time. By asking people to help make sense of the reported data, we invoke the wisdom of the crowd to help us separate signal from noise. We also hope to engage the public in public health and try to show the importance of these issues.
