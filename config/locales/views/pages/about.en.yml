        "Crowdbreaks is a crowdsourced disease surveillance system, currently developed by the %{href_group} at %{href_EPFL} in Switzerland. 
        The system is designed to track trends about major health and disease-related issues in real-time across different countries.  
        By obtaining feedback from users the system will eventually improve and be able to draw more accurate conclusions about these issues."

      how_does_it_work:
        "Crowdbreaks collects tweets with keywords that might be related to disease. 
        By using natural language processing and machine learning techniques the system tries to filter relevant from non-relevant content.
        By providing more meta information (labelling) of the tweets, these algorithms will continuously improve to detect tweets which are truly relevant for disease surveillance.

      why_crowdsourcing_html:
        "Early detection of disease outbreaks is perhaps our best bet to keep diseases in check.
        While public health systems are already in place to help us with early detection, the resources available for these systems are limited.
        There is also a time delay from the moment someone starts to fall ill to the moment public health authorities are alerted.
        At the same time, millions of people use social media to share how they feel, both good and bad.
        In a very real sense, it's like having millions of sensors to help us understand the health situation on the ground.
        Crowdbreaks, however, goes one step further: by asking people to help make sense of the reported data, we invoke the wisdom of the crowd to help us separate signal from noise. 
        We also hope to engage the public in public health."
